## Abstract
Autonomous vehicles have gained prominence in smart cities, and their reliance on wireless communication makes them susceptible to cyberattacks, including DDoS attacks, GPS spoofing, and malware injection. This research project introduces an intrusion detection system (IDS) powered by machine learning to safeguard autonomous vehicle networks. It involves:

- Data preprocessing to prepare the dataset.
- Application of machine learning algorithms for DDoS attack detection.
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of different algorithms.
- Proposed algorithms for autonomous vehicle modules and software.

## Proposed Work
The proposed work includes the development of an intrusion detection system that aims to detect DDoS attacks, GPS spoofing, and malware injection. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
The DDoS attack detection algorithm improves the security of autonomous vehicles by identifying DDoS attacks using Wi-Fi Intrusion Detection System. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of machine learning classifiers to detect and analyze DDoS attacks.
